# Spot Each Equal

A fast-paced game of attention and reaction. Players must find identical images on two cards faster than their opponents. The game includes 55 main cards, each containing several images. Any two cards share exactly one matching image, which players must find during the game.

## üéÆ Game Modes

- **Mine!**  
  Each player receives one card. The remaining cards are placed face down in the center. The first player to find a match between their card and the central card takes the central card and places it on top of their own stack. The game continues until all cards are taken. The player with the most cards wins. Unlike the similar game "Grab-it," here the card is placed on top of your stack, not in a discard pile.

- **Yours!**  
  Similar rules to "Mine!", but players look for matches between the central card and opponents‚Äô cards, giving the matched cards to them. The player with the fewest cards at the end wins.

- **Memo**  
  Players try to find the matching image on their card from memory.

- **Discard**  
  All cards are dealt to players. When a match is found, it is discarded to the central pile.

- **Duel**  
  A two-player mode. Players try to take all of their opponent's cards.

- **Pile-Up**  
  The most fun mode. All cards are spread on the table, and players simultaneously search for pairs to take.

### üÉè Shadow Cards
There are 10 black-and-white shadow cards that correspond to colored cards. Finding a shadow pair earns an extra point.
